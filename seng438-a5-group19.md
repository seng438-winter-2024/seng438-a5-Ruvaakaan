The graphs above indicate that the TL and IFRSGB models excel in accuracy. The overlaid graphs illustrate their performance in representing the inputted data accurately. Additionally, their Log-Likelihood scores surpass those of other models, with the TL model scoring -137.074 and the IFRSGB model scoring -137.030, further validating their effectiveness.
