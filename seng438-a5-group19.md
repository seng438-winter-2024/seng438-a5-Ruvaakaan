# Introduction 

# Reliability Growth Testing 

** Result of model comparison (two top models) **

** Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis) **

** Plots for failure rate and reliability of the SUT for the test data provided **

** A discussion on decision making given a target failure rate **

# Reliability Demonstration Chart Testing

** 3 plots for MTTFmin, twice and half of it for your test data **

MTTFmin = 

RDC for MTTF * 2: 

RDC for MTTF * 0.5: 

RDC for MTTF: 

** Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decided on MTTFmin **

** A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC **

# Comparison of Results from Part 1

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
