**Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis)**

**Plots for failure rate and reliability of the SUT for the test data provided**

**A discussion on decision making given a target failure rate**

# Reliability Demonstration Chart Testing

**3 plots for MTTFmin, twice and half of it for your test data**

MTTFmin = 

RDC for MTTFmin * 2: 

RDC for MTTFmin * 0.5: 

RDC for MTTFmin: 

**Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decided on MTTFmin**

**A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC**

# Comparison of Results from Part 1

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
