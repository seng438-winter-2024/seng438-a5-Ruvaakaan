The graph and table above clearly demonstrate that the Truncated Logistic (TL) and IFR Generalized Salvia & Bollinger (IFRSGB) reliability models outperform others in fitting the failure data, thereby offering more accurate predictions for variables such as time to release and remaining failures. Moreover, their Log-Likelihood scores, notably -137.074 for the TL model and -137.030 for the IFRSGB model, exceed those of alternative models, providing further evidence of their effectiveness.

The dataset utilized for C-SFRAT analysis is sourced from the CDS.DAT file. Despite our thorough search, we were unable to locate any pertinent information regarding the covariates E (execution time measured in hours), F (failure identification work measured in person hours), and C (computer time failure identification measured in hours) within the provided failure data. Consequently, we have opted to solely incorporate "None" as a covariate for assessing the models' performance.


**Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis):**

The plot above reveals a downward trend in the number of failures within the system as time progresses. Although there is a slight uptick in failures at time = 35, subsequent observations suggest a diminishing likelihood of future failures. This trend indicates a decreasing risk of system failures as time advances.
